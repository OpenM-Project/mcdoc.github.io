It takes care of managing and protecting digital content from the Microsoft Store, like apps and games, to make sure they follow licensing rules and digital rights management (DRM). ClipSVC is used in the process of checking the license, so disabling it will break every single licensing system and no process related to it can be run. In meaning, you could force stop ClipSVC and get apps for free. But since it breaks Minecraft completely too, you will need to do other steps.<br><strong>Runtime Broker</strong> makes sure Minecraft follows its licensing rules and security settings. Since this is there, you will have to End Task it at the correct time, which is when Minecraft buffers loading at 46%.
