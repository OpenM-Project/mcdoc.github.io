The game had a trial version which was limited and you could only play for 60 minutes in a world.</p><p>Then, people started to notice that the paid version and the trial version was the exact same app! So, efforts started to try to unlock the game, and here we are today.</p></div><h2 id="the-beginning-m-centers-online-fix-me" tabindex="-1">The Beginning, M Centers &amp; online-fix.me <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-beginning-m-centers-online-fix-me" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Beginning, M Centers &amp; online-fix.me&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="timeline-dot"><span class="timeline-dot-title">2020-10-10</span><ul><li><strong>The First Method - Force Disabling ClipSVC</strong><ul><li>The first hack to unlock Minecraft, discovered by tinedpakgamer, is the <strong>ClipSVC Method</strong>. With some registry code, you could force stop ClipSVC and prevent it from running in the background. After that, when you start Minecraft, it would buffer at 46% which you would then go and force stop Runtime Broker under Minecraft in Task Manager. And this worked! This was then packed into a program named M Centers by the discoverer. But, this method was the opposite of safe, as it breaks MS Store completely and on 10th October 2022, it got patched in the version <code>1.19.50</code> of Minecraft.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="timeline-dot"><span class="timeline-dot-title">2020-11-15</span><ul><li><strong>The Second Method - DLL Replacing</strong><ul><li>Then came along a permanent method, the <strong>DLL Replacing</strong>. By replacing <code>Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll</code> with <em>Cracked DLLs</em> and making it say the game was licensed, Minecraft was able to be unlocked! This was the method used by Tinedpakgamer in M Centers, released as version 3.0 <em>(2.0 was a sentry launcher using precracked appx. Its development failed and got scrapped)</em>. After M Centers 3.0 became commonly used, M Centers 3.3 was released which did the same thing, but fixed a bug in the previous version.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="timeline-dot"><span class="timeline-dot-title">2022-05-20</span><ul><li><strong>The Third Method - Memory Manipulation</strong><ul><li>In 2021, online-fix.me <em>(a well-known Russian site)</em> released their own version of memory injection crack, which became popular as well. After this, Tinedpakgamer developed M Centers 4.0 which added <strong>Appx Download</strong> and discarded some in-development methods like, <em>DLL RAM Patch</em>, <em>Store Purchase Crack</em> using pre-cracked dlls from a Github repository. M Centers 5.0 was released and it used <strong>In-Memory Code Manipulation</strong> without the need of any DLLs. This version also had a UWP app but it was tricky to install <em>(it needed Developer Mode to be enabled, and made users install his self-signing certificate which was not secure at all)</em>. M Centers 6.0 was released, but it was just a re-made UI for the exact same app <em>(it was intended to provide auto-patching DLLs, but it was never done)</em>.</li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="the-end-of-m-centers-the-rise-of-m-community" tabindex="-1">The End of M Centers &amp; The Rise of M Community <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-end-of-m-centers-the-rise-of-m-community" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The End of M Centers &amp; The Rise of M Community&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="timeline-dot"><span class="timeline-dot-title">2023-12-01</span><ul><li><strong>The DMCA</strong><ul><li>After some time of the releases, Tinedpakgamer announced the end of M Centers, and started slowly deleting everything related to him. The reason for this was because he wanted a break and also had his identity leaked, so this was why he had left.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="timeline-dot"><span class="timeline-dot-title">2024-01-15</span><ul><li><strong>SOMEONE</strong><ul><li>While M Centers was slowly shutting down, a user named <strong>someone1060</strong> created a server named &quot;M Community&quot; and shared it through a major chunk of users on the M Centers server. his server, M Community, was the unofficial revival and archive of M Centers. As this server got increasingly popular, tinedpakgamer found out about it then proceeded to delete the invitation message. But it was too late, and most of the stuff was archived and lots of users were in the server already. M Centers eventually deleted the Discord server, leaving no trace of it.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="timeline-dot"><span class="timeline-dot-title">2024-02-10</span><ul><li><strong>M Centers 7.0 (Akshnav)</strong><ul><li>Later, a video titled something along the lines of &quot;How to get MCBE for free&quot; blew up. This video had linked the M Community server, which caused it to get lots of members. This soon led to M Centers joining the server and uploading M Centers 7.0 <em>(also known as Akshnav)</em> which also used <em>In-Memory Code Manipulation</em>. But this method had some issues.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="timeline-dot"><span class="timeline-dot-title">2024-02-05</span><ul><li><strong>Akshnav</strong><ul><li>It was basically closed-source, it got frequently flagged by AV software as a virus, and you had to open the app and launch Minecraft that way to make it work. It also didn&#39;t work with all versions of Minecraft or Windows, so it was basically just a mess which got some people upset, and some left. Then there was a new player in the game.</li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="the-new-beginning-of-the-openm-project" tabindex="-1">The New Beginning of the OpenM Project <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-new-beginning-of-the-openm-project" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The New Beginning of the OpenM Project&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="timeline-dot"><span class="timeline-dot-title">2024-02-01</span><ul><li><strong>The Decompilation</strong><ul><li>Developers in M Community started work on decompiling Akshnav, cleaning it up and the sorts.
