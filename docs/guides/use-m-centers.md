## Manual Guide

1. Open the Microsoft Store and make sure that you are logged into a Microsoft account.

2. Press the Windows key and R key simultaneously and then type `ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NBLGGH2JHXJ`. This will open the Microsoft Store with the Minecraft for Windows trial page.

::: tip Tip
<p>If step 2 doesn't result in Microsoft Store opening with the Minecraft trial page, instead download Minecraft Launcher from the Microsoft Store and install Bedrock from there, or from the Xbox app, search for <strong>Minecraft for Windows</strong> and download it from there.</p>
:::

3. Then download the trial game by pressing `Get Trial`.

4. Next, download M Centers 8.0 from these following links: [x64](https://github.com/OpenM-Project/m-centers-archive/raw/refs/tags/mcenters8013/M-Centers-8.0.1.3-x64.zip) | [x86](https://github.com/OpenM-Project/m-centers-archive/raw/refs/tags/mcenters8013/M-Centers-8.0.1.3-x86.zip).

5. Extract the zip file and open the file `M Centers.exe` by double clicking the file.

6. Once M Centers opens, click on the 3x3 grid button (3rd button available in the main menu) that will by default show `DLL Method AutoPatch` below it.

7. Click on the button that says `DLL Method Auto Patch`, and then press the `Activate` button which is right next to the `Learn More` button.

8. Click the back button in the top right corner.

9. Click the `Install Cracked DLL` button (1st button available in the main menu) and then press the `Start` button at the bottom of the screen.

10. Once it shows that the install of the hack has been completed, you can close M Centers 8.0

11. Next, open up Minecraft from your taskbar or start menu, and enjoy.
